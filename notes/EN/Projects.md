Here are some projects I done. This page is populated by a MD file and is parsed by a library I made.
# SRC++ | Chrome Extension
SRC++ is a extension for chrome that adds more functions in the website speedrun.com, it has its own popup GUI but also injects buttons on the website itself.

It was made to fix a lack of certain things on the normal website that power users needed.

Features:

- Country Filter for individual pages
- Display Queue for each game (previously only accessible via API)
- Podium display on user profile
- Remove website sidebar (To be more similar with old design)
- Remove Background and custom CSS

# Paceman Extension | Chrome/Firefox
Paceman.gg is a website that shows and tracks players who are speedrunning Minecraft, showing the time and other info.

Paceman Extension is a Chrome and Firefox extension that adds the same functionality in the extension popup, showing current players, and linking them to their livestreams, if they are live.

It also adds the config to whitelist names, so you only see people you know, and only show "Paces" that are quicker than a time that you desire.

# MarkO | Markdown to HTML parser
This is a small JS Lib that I made for this website, its a small Markdown to HTML parser for my specific needs.

Usage: Â "marko.parse(markdownText,config)" if you want to know how to use it, check the github!

It was made to make the html structure more similar to how i use markdown files, with each title creating a new division that i can collapse.

You can add some colors, make text bold and other things that aren't really markdown, but i find useful. You can also make the elements do the behavior you want using CSS classes, so if you want the bold text be green, just add it in the config

If you need as example of how it works, check the source code of this website!.

# MCSR Brasil | Community Archive
MCSR Brasil is a website that i maintain to archive info about the Brazilian Minecraft speedrunning community, which I have been an active member for years.

The website has:
- Brazilian leaderboard of several categories
- States leaderboard with an interactive map
- Timeline with Brazilian Record history
- A Back-end made with google sheets so non tech savvy members can contribute after I'm no longer in charge
- Internal system to facilitate editing the sheet, with checks for each input, and easier way to edit rows, making it more like SQL queries.

# Minecraft Mods
I have made some mods for Minecraft, I'm not going to explain the technical terms, but the link to get them will be below

All of them are datapacks that are also packaged as mods.
I like making datapacks over mods because i think it is a superior way to add custom things on servers, and i think more people should be looking at them, specially now that Mojang is adding a lot of functionality to them.

They can be downloaded as mods, or as datapacks and resource packs.
